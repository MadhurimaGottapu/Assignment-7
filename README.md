This script fetches data from the 'wildlife' section on Reddit using a tool called PRAW. It utilizes various libraries including pandas for data organization, credentials for secure login details, matplotlib for generating graphs, and sqlite3 for database operations.

Getting Started
Before running the script, ensure you have installed the necessary libraries. You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install praw pandas matplotlib
Additionally, you need to have SQLite installed to interact with the database.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required credentials for Reddit API access. Store them securely in a file named credentials.py.
Run the script reddit_data_analysis.py. It will connect to Reddit, fetch the top 10 popular posts from the 'wildlife' section, and display their titles and scores.
The script then collects information about each post such as title, link, author, number of comments, score, and text content. This information is stored in a pandas DataFrame.
The DataFrame is then written into a SQLite database named co_reddit.sqlite.
Visualizations are generated to provide insights into the data:
Histogram of post scores
Box plot of the number of comments
Scatter plot of score vs. number of comments
Bar plot of top 10 authors
